<h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
<h2>Who i am</h2>
<p>I am Jérémi, a passionate IT engineer from Auxerre, a small city located in Bourgogne Franche-Comté, France.</p>
<p>Freshly graduated from EPSI engineering school and with three years of experiences, i wish upon putting my passion to use in a company.</p>
<p>I am fairly familiar with quite a number of tools and languages, as i like to think variety is a strong point of the work of developper, however, i think my favorite technologies so far are JavaScript (and his frameworks) and Python.</p>
<p>I am also very fond of cybersecurity, a specialty i wish to dive into!</p>
<p>If you are looking for a young motivated software engineer feel free to contact me!</p>
<h2>Where you are</h2>

<p>You probably already noticed, but thi website is hosted on github, a tool i am quite proefficient with due my years using it has a professionnal.</p>
<p>Github Pages was my tool of choice when i decided to do a portfolio, and if you have any suggestions about it, i am fully listening.</p>
